# fish-age-estimation-svm

In this project, I build a support vector machine classifier and regression models to predict the age of an Abalone fish based on their physical measurements. The age of the fish is denoted by the number of rings on this fish. I start by cleaning and preparing the data set, then I take my best guess for the hyperparameters and kernel to use in the support vector classifier (SVC). Next, I'll test out different kernels and hyper parameters to fine tune the SVC. 

I'm curious about how the results will be affected if I keep the rings variable continuous and employ a support vector regression (SVR). I'll take a similar approach as I did to the SVC and evaluate the two models by comparing their recall, precision, and f-measures.
